# FaceSplitScripter
Utility that turns a copy/pasted lootsplit total column into a Razor script that will pull items.

All tomes (Aspect/Tmap/Scroll) must be in a single container alongside Skill Orbs and MCDs to function.

Does not error if there are insufficient quantities in tomes or stacks, though you should get a unique sysmsg.


# Usage
1. Paste the lootsplit column for a player into the top box.
2. Copy paste the script into an empty Razor script.
3. Hit [Run] in Razor, then select the container to pull from.
4. Pull out any manual items listed that couldn't be automated.
5. Enjoy.
